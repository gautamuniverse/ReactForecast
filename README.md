2. **Manual Location Entry:** Allows users to manually enter their desired location.
3. **Real-time Weather Details:** Provides real-time weather details for the current location.
4. **Forecast Details:** Displays forecast details for the input location, including the maximum date (up to 6 days from now).
5. **Error Handling:** Implements error handling using alerts for a smooth user experience.
